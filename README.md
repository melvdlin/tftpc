# TTFTP
<p align="center">a (Tremendously) Trivial File Transfer Protocol implementation </p>

TTFTP is a sans-io, no-std, no-alloc TFTP implementation
as according to [RFC 1350](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1350).
Currently, this crate implements only a client and does not support options.
